# ATM Machine Project

## Problem Statement
Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) allow users to perform essential banking operations such as checking their balance, depositing money, and withdrawing cash. This project aims to create a simple ATM simulation using Python, providing users with a command-line interface to manage their transactions securely.

## Project Description
This Python-based ATM system includes the following functionalities:
- *Check Balance*: Users can view their current account balance.
- *Deposit Money*: Users can add funds to their account.
- *Withdraw Money*: Users can withdraw money while ensuring they have sufficient balance.
- *Exit System*: Users can safely exit the ATM simulation.

The project is designed with proper input validation to handle errors gracefully and provide a smooth user experience.

## Tech Stack Used
- *Programming Language*: Python
- *IDE/Text Editor*: Any Python-supported IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook, etc.)

## Hardware & Software Requirements
### Hardware:
- A system with at least 4GB RAM
